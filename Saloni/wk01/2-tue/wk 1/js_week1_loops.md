# The even/odd reporter

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

# Multiplication Tables

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

Bonus: Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).

# Your top choices

Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).

For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."

Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.
